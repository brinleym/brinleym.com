Over the years, I've noticed that people tend to misuse Powerpoint. I was one
of these people, until I started researching what separates the occaisonal 
effective PowerPoint presentation from the rest. I've compiled my 
findings in this post.

## Why most PowerPoints suck

The majority of PowerPoint presentations suck for one of two reasons:
1. **Mistake #1** - PowerPoint is used when it is not necessary
2. **Mistake #2** - PowerPoint is necessary, but the PowerPoint slides are poorly 
formatted

## Avoiding Mistake #1 - Using PowerPoint when it's not necessary

You can instantly become better at PowerPoint simply by interrogating whether or 
not a PowerPoint presentation is truly necessary. As you do this, here are some 
helpful heuristics to keep in mind:
* PowerPoint is **not** a good tool for facilitating meetings
* PowerPoint is **not** a good medium for providing supplementary notes to an 
audience
* PowerPoint should **not** be used as a script or outline for the presenter

### PowerPoint is not a good tool for meeting facilitation

Through my research on PowerPoint, I learned a lot about how the most effective
corporate leaders run meetings. One common thread is that they all
despise the use of PowerPoint. Some, including Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Elon
Must, have gone so far as to ban PowerPoint.

<Quote>I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking. People 
confront problems by creating presentations. I want them to engage, to hash 
things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know 
what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint. - Steve Jobs</Quote>

<Quote>Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, 
flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the innerconnectedness 
of ideas [...] The reason writing a 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 
page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better
thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how 
things are related. - Jeff Bezos</Quote>

<Quote>Are CEOs in corporate America focused enough on product improvement? I think 
the answer is no. Spend less time on finance, spend less time in conference 
rooms, less time on PowerPoint and more time just trying to make your product 
as amazing as possible. - Elon Musk</Quote>

If you are motivated to have an impactful career, it's important to 
question whether spending your time in meetings is a good use of your
energy. Avoid unnecessary meetings whenever possible.  
<br />
This is especially true for engineers, since meetings will take time 
away from the focused, hands-on work required to build and improve a product. 
As Musk says, you should spend less time on meetings/PowerPoint engineering 
and more time on product engineering.  
<br />
If a meeting is truly necessary, then use Bezos'
approach of requiring attendees to present ideas in 4-6 page memos 
(rather than PowerPoints). This will "force" deeper thinking a "better
understanding of what's important."  
<br />
**What if I'm a junior engineer who doesn't run meetings? 
How can I effect change?**
As an engineer, it's critical to work in an environment where
ideas for improving productivity are seriously considered. If this is not the
case, it is unlikely you will change the culture in your current position and
you should leave your project and/or your company as soon as possible.

### PowerPoint is not a good medium for supplementary notes

Supplementary material should never be included in a PowerPoint presentation as
this type of material will reduce an audience's ability to comprehend your
core message. Instead, put supplementary material in a memo that is distribted
after the presentation.

### PowerPoint should not be used as a "script" or "outline" for the presenter

PowerPoint presentations are for the audience, not the presenter. This
seems like I'm stating the obvious, but 99% of PowerPoints seem to have been 
constructed without any appreciation of this key tenet.   
<br />
As you construct PowerPoint slides, ask yourself if your slides will truly 
enhance your audience's comprehension of your message. Slides that are heavy
in text typically have a negative impact on audience comprehension. While 
slides that include simple visuals can positively impact audience comprehension. 
If you catch yourself constructing slides that are designed to
to "jog" your memory during a presentation, you should question whether you are 
equipped to give a presentation at all.

## Avoiding Mistake #2 - PowerPoint slides are poorly formatted

According to a team of public speaking experts at Penn State, people are prone 
to crafting poorly formatted PowerPoint slides because 
["PowerPoint defaults are weak."](https://vimeo.com/385725081) 
In short, PowerPoint defaults encourage presenters to format their ideas
as "bullet points," which leads to text-heavy slides that are cluttered, 
disorganized, and antithetical to audience comprehension.
<br />
To combat this problem, the same team at Penn State created the [Assertion
Evidence Model](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/) to encourage presenters to 
create talks that "are comprehended better by audiences and project more 
confidence from speakers."

### The Three Principles of the Assertion Evidence Model

The key to the success of the Assertion Evidence Model is the constraints it
imposes on PowerPoint presentations - also known as the [Principles of 
Assertion Evidence](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/principles.html):

1. **Principle #1** - You must break away from the PowerPoint mold. This means that 
instead of constructing each slide around a topic, each slide should be focused around a 
key message - also known as your “assertion.” Messages should be developed 
outside of PowerPoint (such as on sticky notes) and you should only move to 
PowerPoint once you’ve established what each slide's message will be. 
2. **Principle #2** - Support each slide’s central message (i.e. assertion) with 
visual evidence (not bullet points). 
3. **Principle #3** - Get comfortable with your content through practice so that 
you project confidence during your presentation. DO NOT memorize a script. 
Rather, know the content well enough that you can form off-the-cuff sentences 
to support each slide’s assertion. 

### How to use the Assertion Evidence Model

The Assertion Evdience team has a helpful [website](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/) 
that includes [improved PowerPoint templates](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/templates.html) 
to get you started. However, it's important to note that the Assertion Evidence 
templates alone will not make a great presentation. In order to give a great 
presentation, you must have sufficient motivation to prepare your presentation 
and practice your talk.

## In Summary

In today's world, too many people fail to question to need for PowerPoint and
meetings more generally. Get into the habit using meetings and PowerPoint as
sparingly as possible. If you find yourself in a change-resistant culture 
where meetings and PowerPoint are overvalued, leave as quickly as possible.
<br />
When you must use PowerPoint, get familiar with the Assertion Evidence Model 
and use it to form your presentation. And always remember that the heart of your 
presentation is you and your idea - not your slides.
