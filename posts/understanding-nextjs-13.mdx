I created a [course](https://brinleym.notion.site/A-Gentle-Introduction-to-Next-js-13-70cca5bad797491ba43910a42461db61?pvs=4) 
that teaches web developers the fundamentals of Next.js 13, the 
latest version of Next.js.
Throughout this course, you'll learn:
- How to build a Next.js app with the new `app` directory and **App Router**
- When and how to use **Client** and **Server Components**
- How to create beautiful loading skeletons with **Suspense Boundaries**
- How to gracefully handle errors with **Error Boundaries**

## Why should I take this course?

Next.js has absolutely revolutionzed the way web apps are built with React. 
It is an indispensible tool for any frontend engineer / React
developer and is arguably the most important frontend technology to learn in
2023, outside of React itself. This course will enable you to learn Next.js 
quickly, so you can use it to build React apps more efficiently.
