Last November, I was among the millions of humans who were both surprised and 
inspired by ChatGPT's breathtaking coding abilities. As a coder myself, I felt 
compelled to understand three things:
1. Just how "good" is ChatGPT at coding? Obviously, the anecdotes from users is that ChatGPT is very good at coding. However, I wanted to find concrete numerical data to objectively answer this question
2. How did ChatGPT get so good at coding?
3. As a software engineer whose job security depends on my coding skills, what will ChatGPT - and its future versions - mean for me?

I thoroughly researched these questions and have compiled my findings in a 
[podcast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gl8E0v2KBmLAtkMorCZwepIzdi6HS2kr/view?usp=drive_link) 
— featuring interviews with several guests, including another software 
engineer, a top AI researcher, and a CS professor. I'm writing this post to 
summarize my findings - as I'm aware podcasts aren't everyone's 
preferred medium.

Note: My research covered a variety of Large Language Models, chatbots, and 
AI-based code generation tools, including ChatGPT, Github Copilot, GPT4, 
and AlphaCode.

## How did ChatGPT get so good at coding?

According Dr. Omar Costilla Reyes (an Machine Learning researcher 
at MIT), a key moment in the lead up to ChatGPT occurred a little over 10 
years ago. This key moment was the development of AlexNet - a ground breaking 
neural network for image classification. In 2012, the creators of AlexNet 
entered it into a competition for classifying image where it blew away its 
competitors. 

Omar noted that for many ML researchers, AlexNet was an important "proof of 
concept" for neural networks - a type of machine learning model that is based 
on the human brain. While neural networks had been around for decades, AlexNet 
was the first time a neural network had been used to solve a "practical problem, 
at a large scale."

Looking back, many ML researchers say that AlexNet was an early sign of the 
so-called "big bang" of Deep Learning - a sub-field of Machine Learning that 
deals with the development of neural networks. This is because AlexNet benefited 
from a confluence of three critical technologies that were finally reaching 
maturity after decades of development. These critical technologies were:
1. Deep neural network architectures
2. Extremely large and high quality public datasets. Specifically, AlexNet was trained on a dataset called ImageNet, which has its own [interesting backstory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_u4AHNjOpk&t=541s) and is arguably just as important to the field of Deep Learning as AlexNet itself
3. And finally, a new generation of graphics processing units that were highly effective at speeding up the training of machine learning models 

After this so-called "big bang" of deep learning, it was clear to ML researchers 
that the process of training a neural network to discover the optimal program 
for certain computational tasks, such as image recognition, was far superior to 
a human programmer sitting down and using basic heuristics to write a program 
for the same task. A decade later, ChatGPT finally caught the rest of the world
up to this fact.

## What does ChatGPT mean for software engineers?

It's hard to predict the future. However, as a software engineer myself, I 
firmly believe that Large Language Models like ChatGPT will disrupt software 
engineering more than any other field. Keeping in mind that future predictions 
are usually inaccurate, here are some *tentative* predictions (based on my 
personal experience with ChatGPT as well as expert interviews):

- **ChatGPT will influence language choice.** In our interview, Dr. Jules White 
(a Computer Science professor at Vanderbilt) mentioned that ChatGPT will 
probably encourage greater use of languages that ChatGPT is very good at, 
namely Python and Javascript. While Python and Javascript were extremely 
popular prior to ChatGPT, ChatGPT will likely drive even more developers to 
adopt these languages, at the expense of less popular scripting languages — 
like Ruby and Perl.
- **ChatGPT will not turn bad programmers into great programmers.** I firmly 
believe that ChatGPT will not close the chasm between bad programmers and 
great programmers because great programmers are great a variety of skills that
include (but are not limited to) writing code. Here is a non-exhaustive list
of some of the skills that great programmers are really good at:
    * System design
    * API design
    * User Interface (UI) design
    * Testing
    * Talking to customers
    * Talking to other engineers
    * Writing documentation
    * Debugging code
    * Debugging other people's code
    * Refactoring code
    * Refactoring other people's code  
    * Learning new things
    * Automating their work

  Getting really good at above skills requires hard work and a relentless drive to 
  self improve. While I certainly believe AI will get better at all of the above 
  skills, there is no replacement for hard work. Thus, I believe that great 
  programmers will be more likley to put in the work to adapt to the inevitable 
  changes that AI brings about. This means that, if anything, AI will widen the 
  gap between high and low performers, as it gives high performers the ability to 
  do more with less.
- **Prompt Engineering is a thing.** In our interview, Dr. White mentioned that 
prompt engineering will be a critical skill for software engineers in the 
ChatGPT era. Luckily, research shows that software engineers are already better 
than the average person at prompt engineering. I think this is because we are
more likely to treat prompt engineering like the process of debugging code,
where we try something, see if it works, and iterate on the solution from there.
However, this is definitely a skill that software engineers should consider 
investing time into learning and improving. One way to learn prompt 
engineering is simply to use ChatGPT and/or Github Copilot whenever you code. 
There are also several Coursera courses on prompt engineering for 
software engineers (including Dr. White's own [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering)) 
- **ChatGPT will *eventually* replace software engineers.** This is something 
that I spoke about at length with Adam Hughes, a fellow software engineer from 
the Northeast. In an article that was covered by Business Insider, Adam predicted a 
fairly aggressive timeline for ChatGPT replacing 100% of software engineers: just 
10 years. While I think the process will be a lot slower, I agree with Adam. 
ChatGPT will eventually replace software engineers. It's less clear what 
types of human-friendly jobs will be left in its wake. However, thus far, the 
progression of software and computer technology has pushed software engineers 
to higher and higher layers of abstraction, so my best guess is that human software 
engineers will be displaced to even higher layers of abstraction that reside 
on top of AI-based code generation tools, like ChatGPT.

## Myth Busting

### All ChatGPT does is <q>remix</q> text it's been trained on, so it will always be dependent on human coders to improve

Research from the top AI institutions has shown that ChatGPT does not just 
“remix” text it's been trained on. In fact, researchers have discovered that 
Large Language Models are able to come up with novel solutions to difficult 
coding problems that are *not* found in their training data. 

For example, when a group of Google researchers entered one of their [AI models 
into a coding competition with 5,000 human competitors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07814.pdf), 
they observed two really important things:

1. Number one, they found "no evidence that our model copies core logic from training data" 
2. And number two, their model copied code from its training data at a rate very similar to the amount of code that the *human* competitors copied from the training data

But how could the human coders in this coding competition possibly know what was 
in Google's training set? Well, the answer is that the code that both the AI 
model and human competitors "copied" was "mostly boilerplate code for 
reading and parsing input data." In other words, both the humans and the AI 
model leaned heavily on extremely common coding patterns for tedious tasks like 
reading input data, but were still able to use a degree of creativity to come 
up with the core logic for solving a problem. 

These early signs of creativity open up the possibility that AI might one day be 
able to write code to improve itself, without intervention from humans.

### If you are a software engineer who is worried about being replaced by ChatGPT, then you are probably bad at your job

As of today, Machine Learning models are objectively better at discovering 
solutions for certain computational tasks, such as image recognition and 
image generation, than even the best human programmer. However, it does not 
follow that the best human programmer is bad at their job. In the case of image 
recognition, Machine Learning has outstripped the abilities of *all* human 
programmers - competent and incompetent alike.

In fact, many of today's top human programmers have wholeheartedly embraced 
ChatGPT as a way of automating a large subset of their work, including Andrej
Karpathy (formally the head of AI at Tesla, now an engineer at OpenAI):

<Quote>
  Copilot has dramatically accelerated my coding, it's hard to imagine going 
  back to manual coding. Still learning to use it but it already writes ~80% 
  of my code, ~80% accuracy. I don't even really code, I prompt. & edit.

No programmer can avoid being replaced by AI, so the best programmers will 
likely be the ones who are quickest to pivot to new AI-based tech stacks to 
take advantage of their productivity enhancements.

### ChatGPT has made technical coding interviews obsolete

While ChatGPT has definitely made it a lot easier to cheat on coding interviews, 
I don't foresee coding interviews going away anytime soon. This is because, as 
of today, knowing the general outline for a solution to a coding problem is 
still a lot faster than not knowing how to solve a problem and asking ChatGPT 
to come up with a solution from scratch. This is because ChatGPT still makes 
lots of mistakes and struggles to come up with solutions to hard coding problems 
(e.g., Leetcode Hard problems). Obviously, as ChatGPT gets better at coding, 
the nature of technical coding interviews will evolve. But as long as software 
engineers are around, technical coding interviews are here to stay.

### ChatGPT is a <q>chatbot</q>

If I had to choose one important takeaway from my expert interviews, its 
something Dr. White mentioned towards the end of our interview:

<Quote>
  ChatGPT is not a text generation engine. It's not an oracle that answers 
  questions like Google. I think all of those things are missing the mark. It's 
  a completely new computational architecture that has capabilities that we 
  don't fully understand yet. 
  <cite>- Dr. Jules White</cite>
</Quote>

This sentiment — that ChatGPT (and Large Language Models more broadly) are not 
"just chatbots," but rather, a whole new computational architecture — is one 
that is shared by some top AI researchers, including Andrej Karpathy:

<Quote>
  With many 🧩 dropping recently, a more complete picture is emerging of LLMs not 
  as a chatbot, but the kernel process of a new Operating System. E.g. today it 
  orchestrates:

  - Input & Output across modalities (text, audio, vision)
  - Code interpreter, ability to write & run programs
  - Browser / internet access
  - Embeddings database for files and internal memory storage & retrieval

  A lot of computing concepts carry over. Currently we have single-threaded 
  execution running at ~10Hz (tok/s) and enjoy looking at the assembly-level 
  execution traces stream by. Concepts from computer security carry over, with 
  attacks, defenses and emerging vulnerabilities.

  I also like the nearest neighbor analogy of "Operating System" because the 
  industry is starting to shape up similar:
  Windows, OS X, and Linux > GPT, PaLM, Claude, and Llama/Mistral(?🙂).
  An OS comes with default apps but has an app store.
  Most apps can be adapted to multiple platforms.

  TLDR looking at LLMs as chatbots is the same as looking at early computers as 
  calculators. We're seeing an emergence of a whole new computing paradigm, and 
  it is very early.

## In Summary

In summary, I believe AI will disrupt software engineering more than any other
field. Moreover, Large Language Models like ChatGPT are shaping up to be more
than just "chatbots" and are probably the foundational technology for the next 
generation of computers. 
In fact, there are many startups that are trying to build consumer devices that
are more deeply integrated with Large Language Models, including [Humane](https://hu.ma.ne/) 
and [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/). There are also [early signs that OpenAI 
might be building a consumer device](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/designer-jony-ive-and-open-ais-sam-altman-discuss-ai-hardware-project).
With all this change happening, I think software engineers will do ourselves a
favor by embracing and experimenting with new AI-based tech stacks, even if it's
just on our own time.  

The release of ChatGPT was a huge turning point in 
human history, so I think I will always fall short in describing how important it
will be for software engineers and non-software engieners alike. Thus, I think
it's best that I end this article with a quote from someone who is much better
at putting words on a page than I am:

  Nothing else in the world...not all the armies...is so powerful as an idea whose time has come.
