In this day and age, building a website is as easy as creating a Word doc with
a few extra considerations. Generally, these extra considerations (performance,
security, etc.) are what trip up non-technical folks. This post will teach you
everything you need to know to build and publish a website, so you can feel
empowered to do this on your own - even without any technical know how.

## Understanding the Principles of Amazing Websites

Building a website in no-code website builder like WiX or Squarespace will feel
a lot like editing a word doc. However, there are a few extra things you'll 
need to know in order to maximize your website's user experience. I've 
encapsulated these things in my **Principles of Amazing Websites:**
1. **Principle #1.** Your website must **load fast**
2. **Principle #2.** Your website must **look good on mobile phones**
3. **Principle #3.** Your website must be **easy to navigate**
4. **Principle #4.** Your website must **use HTTPS**
5. **Principle #5.** Your website must **be accessible** to as many people as
possible, including people who use screen readers

### Principle 1. Your website must load fast

Due to improvements in internet architecture, browser technology, and 
web development 
practices, we have become accustomed to websites loading nearly instantaneously. In
fact, 40% of your users will leave your website if it takes longer than 3
seconds to load. Hence, you should aim for your home page to load in 
**2.5 seconds or less.**

builder with the fastest page loads.](https://www.softwarepundit.com/website-builder/which-website-builder-loads-the-fastest)

### Principle 2. Your website must look good on mobile phones

Today, most people are completely tethered to their phones. It shouldn't be
surprising then that nearly 50% of your users will be coming from their phones.
This number will only grow in the coming years, so it is essential that your
website looks good and functions well on a variety of screen sizes, including
smart phones. Luckily, no-code website builders like WiX and Squarespace will 
try to adapt your website to smaller screen sizes automatically. However, it's 
still important that you routintely test your website on smaller screen sizes 
to ensure it looks and functions as you intend it to.
<br/>
Pro Tip #1: No-code website builders like Squarespace and Wix have buttons 
that enable you to view your site on smaller screen sizes.
<br/>
Pro Tip #2: No-code website builders like Squarespace and Wix offer website 
templates that automatically adapt to smaller screen sizes, so consider using 
a template instead of starting with a "blank" site.

### Principle 3. Your website must be easy to navigate

Studies show that nearly 40% of new users will immediately look at a website's
navigation menu. Hence, your website's navigation menu should be easy to find
and structured in an intuitive way. A good heuristic is that it should
take new users no more than 10 seconds to find what they're looking for on
your website.

Sometimes, web designers will try to make a website more distinctive by formatting
the navigation menu in an unconventional way. However, user experience
studies show that this is a mistake. It's better to stick to the conventions on
the placement and structure of your website's navigation menu. This means:
* **For desktop users:** The navigation menu should be "stuck" to the top of a 
website or placed in a sidebar on the left side of a website
* **For mobile users:** The menu should be accessible from a "hamburger" menu in
the top-left or top-right corner of a website or "stuck" to the very bottom
of a website 
<br/>
Pro tip: No-code website builders like Squarespace and Wix offer 
website templates that structure the navigation menu in an intuitive way by
default 

### Principle 4. Your website must use HTTPS

**HTTPS** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.** HTTPS ensures 
that the data sent between your site and your users is encrypted.
<br />
When your site uses HTTPS, users will be able to access your site on a URL 
like `https://yourdomain.com` and/or `https://www.yourdomain.com`. Without 
HTTPS, users will only be able to access your site from URLs that start with 
`http:`.
<br />
HTTPS has become so essential that Google penalizes websites that don't use it 
by showing them lower in search results. Some browsers (including Chome) will 
even warn users before allowing them to open sites that don't use HTTPS. 
<br />
Pro Tip #1: No-code website builders like Squarespace and Wix enable HTTPS
automatially. 
<br />
Pro Tip #2: Even if HTTPS is enabled for your site, users may still be able to
access your website insecurely using standard HTTP from a URL like 
`http://yourdomain.com`. No-code website builders like Squarespace and Wix 
have have the option of forcing users to use HTTPS 100% 
of the time by redirecting users from `http://yourdomain.com` 
to `https://yourdomain.com`.
