## Overview

I created a [collaborative PC game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfMN_bwEbpo) 
where 3 players must work together to escape a maze. My teammates for this 
project were Timothy Ho, Ben Fuligni, Charlie Yang and Theodore Tan.

## Impact

My Game Design instructor described this innovative game as one of his all time
favorites!
