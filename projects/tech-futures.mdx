## Overview

[Tech Futures](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1870414) is a podcast that profiled The MITRE's Corporation's emerging 
technology research. I was the lead host, writer, and producer on the podcast.

## Impact

The podcast grew to thousands of monthly listeners, many of whom were MITRE's
customers, and won several internal awards.   

Our [podcasts on Quantum Software Engineering](https://mitrestechfuturespodcast.buzzsprout.com/1870414/11071256-quantum-software-engineering) 
were done in collaboration with Richard Preston and Dr. Gerry
Gilbert - a world renowned Quantum Physicist who studied under Stephen Hawking.
These podcasts are currently being incorporated into an MIT course on Quantum Software
Engineering.
