## Overview

[Tech Futures](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1870414) is a podcast that profiled 
The MITRE's Corporation's research into emerging technology. I was the lead 
host, writer, and producer on the podcast.

## Impact

The podcast grew to thousands of monthly listeners (many of whom were MITRE's
customers), won several internal awards, and garnered praise from [MITRE's Chief
Futurist](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clancytc_im-very-very-very-excited-to-announce-activity-6958380246790250496-nE36?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Our [podcasts on Quantum Software Engineering](https://mitrestechfuturespodcast.buzzsprout.com/1870414/11071256-quantum-software-engineering) 
were done in collaboration with Richard Preston and Dr. Gerry
Gilbert - a world renowned Quantum Physicist who studied under Stephen Hawking.
These podcasts are currently being incorporated into an MIT course on Quantum Software
Engineering.
