## Overview

I created a [study guide](https://brinleym.notion.site/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-98ca932ec6a54e47b7de9d089a9776b7) 
for technical coding interviews. The study guide is currently focused around
Javascript. I have future plans to support Typescript, Python, and C++.

Note: This study guide is currently under construction and will be offline
periodically. Consider it a rough draft. If you have any questions, feel free 
to email me at **brinley.macnamara@gmail.com**

## Impact

This study guide enables web developers to quickly get up to speed with the Data 
Structures and Algorithms that are frequently tested in coding interviews.
